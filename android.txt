13. **Q: What is the purpose of an IntentFilter in Android?**
    A: An IntentFilter is used to declare the types of intents that a component can receive. It specifies the actions, data types, and categories that an intent must match to be delivered to a component.

14. **Q: What is a BroadcastReceiver in Android?**
    A: A BroadcastReceiver is a component in Android that allows the application to receive and respond to system-wide or application-specific broadcast messages. It enables communication between different parts of an application or between different applications.

15. **Q: How can you handle user input and events in Android?**
    A: User input and events can be handled by implementing event listeners or callback interfaces for UI elements such as buttons, text fields, and list views. These listeners capture user actions and trigger corresponding actions in your app.

16. **Q: What is the purpose of an Adapter in Android?**
    A: An Adapter is used to bind data to UI elements, such as ListView, GridView, or RecyclerView. It acts as a bridge between the data source and the UI, providing the necessary views for each item in the data set.

17. **Q: How can you make network requests in Android?**
    A: Network requests can be made in Android using classes like HttpURLConnection or OkHttp for low-level networking, or using higher-level libraries like Retrofit or Volley. These libraries simplify the process of making HTTP requests and handling responses.

18. **Q: What is the Android Support Library (now AndroidX)?**
    A: The Android Support Library, now called AndroidX, is a set of libraries provided by Google that extends the functionality of the Android framework. It offers backward compatibility for new features, additional UI components, and utility classes for developers.

19. **Q: What are the different storage options available in Android?**
    A: Android provides several storage options, including internal storage, external storage (SD card), SQLite databases, and cloud-based storage services. The choice of storage depends on the type and size of data you need to store.

20. **Q: How can you implement push notifications in an Android app?**
    A: Push notifications can be implemented using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or other third-party services. These services allow you to send notifications from a server to your app, even when the app is not actively running.

21. **Q: What is the Android Application Lifecycle?**
    A: The Android Application Lifecycle consists of various states an application goes through, including "Running," "Paused," "Stopped," and "Destroyed." These states are managed by the Android system based on user interactions and system events.

22. **Q: How can you handle permissions in Android?**
    A: Android uses a permission system to protect user privacy and restrict app capabilities. Permissions can be requested in the AndroidManifest.xml file, and runtime permissions can be requested from the user programmatically using the permission framework.

23. **Q: What is the purpose of the Android Resource Directory?**
    A: The Android Resource Directory (res) contains various types of resources used in an Android application, such as layouts, strings, drawables, styles, and more. It provides a centralized location to organize and access these resources.

24. **Q: What is the purpose of the Android Gradle Plugin?**
    A: The Android Gradle Plugin is a build tool provided by Google to automate the build process of Android projects. It manages dependencies, compiles code, generates APK files, and performs various other tasks required for building an Android app.

25. **Q: How can you implement data binding in Android?**
    A: Data binding is a technique in Android that allows you to bind UI components directly to data sources. It simplifies UI updates by automatically updating the UI when the underlying data changes. Data binding can be enabled by adding the necessary configurations and annotations to your project.

26. **Q: What is the difference between Serializable and Parcelable in Android?**
    A: Serializable and Parcelable are two mechanisms provided by Android to pass data between components. Serializable uses reflection and is easier to implement but slower, while Parcelable requires manual implementation but is faster and more efficient.

27. **Q: How can you add animations to your Android app?**
    A: Animations can be added to Android apps using various techniques, such as XML-based animations, property animations, View animations, or using third-party animation libraries like Lottie or Tween. These animations can enhance the user experience and add visual appeal to your app.

28. **Q: What is ProGuard in Android?**
    A: ProGuard is a tool that helps reduce the size of the APK file by removing unused code, optimizing bytecode, and obfuscating the code to make it harder to reverse-engineer. It is often used in Android app development to improve performance and protect intellectual property.

29. **Q: How can you localize your Android app for different languages?**
    A: Android provides localization support through resource qualifiers. By creating separate resource files for different languages and regions, you can display the app's content in the user's preferred language based on their device settings.
